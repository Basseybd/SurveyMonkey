This is the homework 2 for Bassey Duke

I used serialization and referred this website
https://howtodoinjava.com/java/serialization/custom-serialization-readobject-writeobject/
in the ReadObjectFromFile and the WriteObjectToFile

Everything else including error checking was done to a reasonable extent.

the test files are located in the Examples directory.

i had serious issues at first which is why this is late.
