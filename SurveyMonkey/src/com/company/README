This is the homework 3&4 for Bassey Duke

I used serialization and referred this website
https://howtodoinjava.com/java/serialization/custom-serialization-readobject-writeobject/
in the ReadObjectFromFile and the WriteObjectToFile

Everything else including error checking was done to a reasonable extent.

the test files are located in their respective directory.

i had serious issues at first which is why this is late.

The examples files are AnimalTest and survey with responses and correct answers stored in their own directories

this should cover homework 3 and 4
